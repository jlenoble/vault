- Do `Ctrl-k v` to see the interactive checkboxes.
- In the new panel, boxes show which steps are already done.

### As an exploration strategy:

- [x] Shallow-clone a github repository XXX (flag `--depth 1`) in `forks` directory. The repository **must** be MIT Licensed, as we don't want to deal with all the intricasies of License entangling.
- [x] Update the README and the LICENSE files of the repository with:
  - [x] At the top of the README file:

  - [x] Find out how to run the test suite, and if any, run it all.
  - [x] Try to run the actual app or to import the package into the sandbox.
  - [x] In VS Code move this file `XXX-import-checklist.md` to `XXX` directory
  - [x] Delete `.git` directory as last step before initial commit.
- [x] Commit all the files as they are with the message: ðŸ”§ chore(XXX): initial fork From: XXX. Revision: RRR. All original files, with amended headers in README.md and LICENSE, and with added file XXX-import-checklist.md, to tag along all integration steps.
